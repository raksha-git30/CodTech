Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
The Quiz Application is a simple yet powerful web-based project developed using core web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to allow users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive immediate feedback, and view their scores upon completion. This project serves as a great learning tool for beginners and intermediate web developers to understand user interaction, DOM manipulation, and event handling in JavaScript, all while creating an engaging and responsive user interface.

Frontend Structure with HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to build the skeleton of the quiz application. It defines all the essential elements such as the quiz container, question title, multiple-choice options (radio buttons or buttons), submit button, and score display area. Semantic HTML tags are used to ensure that the structure is accessible and easy to navigate. Each question and its options are dynamically inserted into the DOM using JavaScript, which makes the application scalable and dynamic.

Styling with CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the visual appearance of the application. The layout is made clean and responsive using Flexbox or Grid, ensuring that the quiz looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Styling includes custom fonts, button hover effects, color schemes for correct and incorrect answers, and transition animations to make the experience interactive. A modern UI design approach is followed, with attention to readability and user engagement.

Functionality with JavaScript
JavaScript is the heart of this application, responsible for all the logic and interactivity. It performs the following core tasks:

Loading Questions Dynamically: All questions and options are stored in a JavaScript array of objects. The script iterates through this array to load each question and its options onto the screen one by one.

Handling User Input: When a user selects an option and submits their answer, JavaScript checks whether the selected option is correct and provides instant feedback.

Score Calculation: The script maintains a score counter that updates based on the user’s answers. At the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed.

Navigating Through Questions: JavaScript handles moving to the next question upon submission, ensuring a smooth flow.

Final Result Display: After the last question, the user receives their total score, and optionally, a message based on performance.
